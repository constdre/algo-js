## Check before each exercise
- How much input validation is needed, is it already non-null, etc.
- Check the 2 samples, the pattern can be inferred from the samples as well.

## Arrays
- firstIndexOf, lastIndexOf
- start at index 1 then look back
- 2d array switching indexes
- index operations - moving forward and back

## Hash Maps
- Storing values as keys in maps for O(1) retrieval

## Binary Search Tree
- For O(log n) - halfing at each iteration

## Utility Functions

### Math.max/min(params numbers)
- You can spread an array of numbers as an arg

### string.replaceAll(regex, string replacement)
- this replaces all instances while replace() only does the first

### string.match(regex/string)
- returns an array containing the matches with the param

## Regex

### Match alphabets only: /[a-z]+/g
- The greedy sign '+' will allow for continuous matching, until there is no more match.
