Monotonic Increasing Stack
Finds the previous smaller element and the next smaller element in 
linear time complexity.

To prevent duplications, the right hand search will be for smaller **or** equal element.

"Monotonic" because the values monotonically increase. 
Where i > j, arr[i] >= arr[j] is always true. Ascending order.
